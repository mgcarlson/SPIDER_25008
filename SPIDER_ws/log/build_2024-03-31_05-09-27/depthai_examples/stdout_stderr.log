CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:46 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddepthai_ros_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "depthai_ros_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "depthai_ros_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    depthai_ros_msgsConfig.cmake
    depthai_ros_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "depthai_ros_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "depthai_ros_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "depthai_ros_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
